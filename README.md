**Description**: We had to make a choose your own adventure with a minimum of 9 pages. We had to collab through github. It also required 3 different types of endings. 

### Peer Review

**Reviewer**:Alan Batres

**Reviewer Notes**: I really like the story and the theme. Good job on the the webpage the only thing I would say to fix is the buttons for the multiple options because the button itself doesn't work unless you the text instead
